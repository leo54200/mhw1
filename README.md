Welcome to the High School Website repository! This project is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and in few weeks evne using JavaScript. It will includes an innovative feature where students can interact with artificial intelligence powered by ChatGPT within a virtual classroom setting to enhance their learning experience.

### Features in progress
* Virtual Classroom: Each student can join virtual classrooms where they can interact with AI students with various levels of knowledge and behavior, facilitated by ChatGPT integration.
* Study Tracking: The website tracks students' study sessions, test grades, and quiz result(provided by teachers on the website periodically) insights into their study habits and progress.
* Teacher Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard for teachers allows them to manage materials and interact with ChatGPT for assistance in creating educational content.
* Study Reminders: The website sends notifications to students, reminding them when they should study based on the technique of spaced repetition using the Ebbinghaus oblivion curve, enhancing study efficiency.
* Future AI Integration: The project aims to develop a proprietary artificial intelligence system tailored specifically for this website's educational purposes.
